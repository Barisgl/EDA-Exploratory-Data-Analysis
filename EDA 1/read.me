# My Goal
In this study I have cleaned first the complicated data. After it was transformed to better understandable and readable, I tried to handle with my missing values. There were a lot of NaN-values on some columns and on the other hand unnecessarily columns existed. Therefore I dropped such columns that I mentioned. After completing the handling with NaN-Values, I tried to handle with outliers. If they are not useful for my target, I have dropped these. But on the other hand if they are to be fixed, I replaced them with NaN-values. And on the end I filled them with suitable values. Finally I have transformed all values in the data to numeric with dummies function.
